The server binary we can understand it’s functionality from the source code, It’s expect 3 lines as input, first one is the action(login/register), the second is username, the third is password; It connects to a mongodb and create a user in case of register or verify the creds and create an otp in case of login. PS: the server’s code import mongodb configs (username,pass, host,port) from a .env file but still uses hardcoded creds, dbname and collection.

Now we got everything for the ssh connection.
